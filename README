This is an example repository to demonstrate that org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseTestingUtility
does not appear to be shutting down correctly.

This assumes you have git installed already.

To replicate

  1) install rvm http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/

     $ bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

  2) follow the post-install rvm instructions
  3) install jruby 1.5.6
  
    $ rvm install jruby-1.5.6

  4) Install the repo demostrating the test

    $ git clone git://github.com/collectiveintellect/hadoop-testing-libs.git

  5) Run the test case, it should hang after successfully passing a single test

    $ cd hadoop-testing-libs
      # you will be prompted from rvm about trusting the .rvmrc, go ahead and
      # accept
    $ rake

SOLVED
======

    The failing issue demostrated in this repo was fixed in HBase 0.90.1
